    <h1>My Dearest</h1>
    <p>As <span class="main">....</span> dawns upon us, 
   We were lying face-to-face, on the same pillow. Our faces were merely two inches apart. Our legs were tangled together, and our warm breaths were mingling in the space between us. Your chest was rising and falling in sync with mine.

With her trembling fingers, you started tracing the edge of my jawline. I rested the flat of my palm on your cheek and caressed your lips with my thumb, slowly wiping away the glossy pink lip gloss.

Our eyes stayed locked as I suddenly slid my hand into her hair and, gripping tightly, pulled you closer. Our lips touched, and you gasped. Your breath now felt hot against my face, and the kiss began slow. My lips explored the taste of yours; your lips explored the taste of mine. Slowly and gently. Inside the blanket, our breathing started sounding louder.

You parted your lips, and I responded immediately by inserting my tongue into your mouth. Our tongues touched, and that touch shivered us both. Your heart began to pound against my chest. As my tongue twisted around yours, you pushed me onto my back and climbed up on me. The kiss turned desperate and dangerous. You pressed your lips harder onto mine; your tongue slipped deeper into my mouth. We both needed air, but we didn't want to break away from that kiss. We weren't merely kissing now, but inhaling each other too. Our breaths also achieved a perfect rhythm. As I exhaled, you inhaled, and as you exhaled, I inhaled.

Gasping, panting, and puffing, we continued kissing. My hand was still in your hair, and the other moved on your back. I was trying to pull you deeper into my body. And you were, as if, trying to pull me up into yours. As we struggled to pull ourselves into each other, the taste of the kiss changed too. It was sugary, and now it started tasting slightly salty, as if our lips were swelling. The kiss continued, though, and our breaths, turning louder and longer, took the temperature inside the blanket to a dangerous degree. But we were not going to end that kiss, even if our breaths burned us. And breathlessly, we kept on kissing.</p>
